# Development of an open source solution for reading analogue Ferraris electricity meters, including the creation of a dashboard to visualise consumption.

*How can a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) be used to read an analogue Ferraris electricity meter and store and visualise the consumption data?*

## Short (functional) description:
The idea of this work is to provide a basic technical infrastructure for reading the electricity consumption of a Ferraris electricity meter. The entire process chain is covered, from data acquisition to data storage and visualisation. The Docker infrastructure allows the interchangeability or flexible extensibility of individual components. The solution is intended as a basic building block for a comprehensive energy monitoring solution.

The aim is a solution that
- is not tied to a home automation system,
- can be used as a complete electricity metering solution,
- can be operated with a single hardware component and
- and which offers the possibility to extend, adapt or replace central components.

Electricity consumption is read from the rotating disc of the Ferraris meter. This is done by attaching an infrared reflective sensor to the meter body. Various 3D printable components can be found online that can be used to attach the sensor module to the electricity meter ([example](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5481772)).

## Hardware used:

* [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb) (4 GB) with power adapter
* Jumper cable
* TCRT5000 optical sensor

### Wiring:

## Software used:

![Software components](/images/software.png)
* [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)
* [**InfluxDB**](https://www.influxdata.com/) as an [InfluxDB docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb) (data storage and data visualisation)
* [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) as a [Python docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) (data collection)

### Configuration:
The **[python.conf](https://github.com/AlexGottschalk/emit/blob/main/python/python.conf)** file is used to access the sensor module and the database. In this file you must specify the pin to which the output of the sensor module is connected. You must also specify the number of revolutions per kilowatt hour of the Ferraris electricity meter. The sampling rate can be left as it is. All other properties can be left as they are.

The **[.env](https://github.com/AlexGottschalk/emit/blob/main/.env)** file is used to initialise the InfluxDB instance (username, password, access token, port, ...). All properties can theoretically be left as they are. However, it is strongly recommended to change the username, password and access token.

As I have not yet found a way to pass the environment variables from the [.env](https://github.com/AlexGottschalk/emit/blob/main/.env) file to the [python.conf](https://github.com/AlexGottschalk/emit/blob/main/python/python.conf) file, the configuration of overlapping properties has to be done twice. This affects the InfluxDB _organisation_, _url (port)_ and access _token_.

## Visualisation:

## Installation steps:

1. Install an [operating system](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/).  
**Note**: The project has been developed and tested using *Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)*.
2. Enable [remote access via SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#ssh) on your Raspberry Pi.  
**Note**: If you are installing the OS using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), SSH remote access can be enabled during installation. In this case, this step can be skipped.
3. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH
using [Linux, Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#secure-shell-from-linux-or-mac-os)
or [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#secure-shell-from-windows-10).
4. Install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
5. Install [Docker on your Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrytips.com/docker-on-raspberry-pi/).
6. Clone or download this repository to a directory of your choice.
7. Navigate to that directory.
8. Make the InfluxDB init script executable (just to be on the safe side):  
```chmod +x ./influxdb/scripts/init.sh```  
**Note**: If this step is skipped, the InfluxDB initialisation script may not run and the template initialisation may fail.
9. Start the container build:   
```docker compose up --build```

***

### Save template changes:
To save changes to InfluxDB components, i.e. dashboards, tasks and so on, you need to export them as a template. When the container is reset, the template can then be initially loaded using the [init script](https://github.com/AlexGottschalk/emit/blob/main/influxdb/scripts/init.sh).

1. Open the terminal of the InfluxDB docker container.
2. Create a configuration for the CLI:  
```influx config create --config-name your_config --host-url http://localhost:8086 --org your_org --token your_token --active```
3. Export (buckets, tasks, dashboards, â€¦) as a new template:  
```influx export all -o your_org -t your_token -f ~/your_template.yml --filter=labelName=your_label```
4. Get your InfluxDB docker container ID:  
```docker container ls```
5. Get the exported template file from the InfluxDB docker container:  
```docker cp your_container_id:/root/your_template.yml ./```


### Examples of extending the solution with additional components:
- [Running InfluxDB 2.0 and Telegraf Using Docker](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/running-influxdb-2-0-and-telegraf-using-docker/)
- [Install Grafana/InfluxDB/Telegraf using Docker Compose](https://dev.to/project42/install-grafana-influxdb-telegraf-using-docker-compose-56e9)
